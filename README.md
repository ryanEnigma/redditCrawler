This is a pretty simple pair of scripts.

The redditCrawl.py will query reddit every 20 minutes and store the data to a text and .p file. The text file is a temp file and
is only used by the redditCrawl script. While the .p file is used by the next script graphRedditData.py. 

Each file has a decent sized read me and plenty of comments. Also at the bottom of both scripts are the name of the functions you
should use in order to run each script correctly. But of course you are free to do what you want with the functions and can
switch them up and add to them as you like
